# @E2-3. Policy Snapshot Timeline Guide (Non-Binding)
## Understanding Time-Fixed Policy Application

### Purpose of This Document

This document provides a human-readable explanation of how LCM applies **policy snapshots** along a timeline.

It is intended to clarify why outcomes are bound to the policy version that was effective at the time of an event, and why later policy changes do not affect past results.

This document is **non-binding** and does not modify or override the **@E1 Constitution**.

### Overview: Why Time Matters

In LCM, **time is not contextual—it is structural**.

Every request, transaction, or event occurs at a specific point in time.  
LCM evaluates that event using the policy state that was valid and active **at that exact moment**, not before and not after.

This approach ensures that outcomes are determined by what was actually in force when the event occurred, rather than by later interpretations or revisions.

---

### What Is a Policy Snapshot

A **policy snapshot** is a fixed representation of a Vendor’s policy as it existed at a specific point in time.

When an event occurs, LCM captures the applicable policy snapshot and uses it as the sole basis for evaluation.  
Once captured, this snapshot does not change, even if the Vendor later updates, replaces, or withdraws the policy.

Think of it as a high-resolution photograph of the rules: once the shutter is pressed at the moment of the event, the image remains unchanged regardless of what happens to the subject later.

The snapshot serves as a time-stamped reference that anchors the outcome to a concrete policy state.

---

### Timeline Illustration (Conceptual)

From a timeline perspective, LCM operates as follows:

- **Before the event**: Multiple policy versions may exist or be prepared  
- **At the moment of the event**: One specific policy version is active and captured  
- **After the event**: Policies may change, but the captured snapshot remains fixed  

LCM does not revisit past events to re-evaluate them under new policies.

---

### No Retroactive Application

LCM does not apply policies retroactively.

A policy update affects **only future events** that occur after the update becomes effective.  
It does not alter outcomes that were already produced under a prior policy snapshot.

In practical terms, changing a policy is similar to changing a rulebook going forward—it does not rewrite the results of actions that already occurred.

---

### Why Snapshot Fixation Exists

Snapshot fixation is a deliberate design choice.

Allowing outcomes to change based on later policy revisions would introduce uncertainty, negotiation, and post-hoc reinterpretation.  
It would also make it impossible to determine which rules actually governed a past decision.

By fixing each outcome to a specific policy snapshot, LCM ensures that:

- Outcomes are predictable at the time of action  
- Historical results remain stable and auditable  
- Responsibility is tied to the policy in force at the moment of the event  
- Disputes over “what should have applied” are structurally eliminated  

---

### Relationship to Audit and Accountability

Because each outcome is bound to a specific policy snapshot, LCM can always show:

- Which policy version was applied  
- When it was applied  
- To which event it applied  

This enables clear audit trails without requiring discretionary explanation or reconstruction of intent.

### Non-Binding Notice

This document is provided for explanatory purposes only.  
It does not create obligations, guarantees, or discretionary pathways.

In the event of any inconsistency between this explanation and the **@E1 Constitution**, the E1 Constitution shall govern.

---

### Summary (Non-Authoritative)

Each event in LCM is evaluated against a **single, fixed policy snapshot**.

Policies may evolve over time, but outcomes do not.  
Once an event is evaluated, its result remains anchored to the policy that was in effect at that moment.
