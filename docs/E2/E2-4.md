# @E2-4. API Access & Consent Flow (Human Guide)
## Understanding Why API Access Requires Explicit Agreement

### Purpose of This Document

This document provides a human-readable explanation of how and why access to LCM APIs is conditioned upon explicit consent to governing terms.

It is intended to clarify the relationship between **contractual assent**, **system eligibility**, and **API availability**.

This document is **non-binding** and does not modify or override the **@E1 Constitution**.

### Overview: API Access Is Not a Feature

In LCM, API access is not a default capability and is not granted automatically.

An LCM-issued API key represents an **active eligibility state** that arises only after explicit agreement to the governing terms, including the **@E1 Constitution**.

An LCM API key is not a gift or a purchase; it is a digital handshake. It remains valid only as long as both hands—the system's rules and your agreement—remain joined.

API access should therefore be understood not as a product feature, but as a **consequence of consent**.

### Why Explicit Consent Is Required

LCM operates as a neutral execution system that applies policies exactly as defined.  
For such a system to function without discretion or exception, all participating parties must agree in advance to the governing rules.

Explicit consent ensures that:

- All parties acknowledge the fixed, non-discretionary nature of outcomes  
- The absence of exceptions and retroactive changes is understood in advance  
- Responsibility for policy definition remains with the policy author  
- LCM’s role as a non-adjudicating execution layer is accepted  

Without this shared understanding, deterministic execution would be indistinguishable from arbitrary behavior.

---

### Consent Before Capability

In many systems, capabilities are granted first and conditions are negotiated later.

LCM follows the opposite model.

Consent precedes capability.  
Only after the governing terms are acknowledged does the system transition into an eligible state that allows API access.

This ordering prevents misunderstandings about what the system will or will not do once requests are submitted.

---

### API Access as a State-Based Outcome

From a system perspective, API access reflects a **state transition**, not a privilege.

- Agreement to governing terms → eligible state  
- Withdrawal or invalidation of agreement → ineligible state  

The issuance, activation, suspension, or revocation of an API key represents changes in system state based on objective conditions, not discretionary enforcement.

LCM does not negotiate, warn, or adjudicate these transitions.  
They occur automatically as a result of eligibility changes.

---

### No Implied Authorization or Endorsement

Possession of an LCM-issued API key does not imply approval, endorsement, or validation of any business activity, content, or policy.

The API key merely indicates that the holder has acknowledged the governing terms and is technically eligible to interact with the system.

All substantive responsibility remains with the policy author and the requesting party.

---

### Human Expectations and Common Misunderstandings

From a human perspective, it may feel counterintuitive that access can be removed without negotiation or review.

LCM does not interpret intent or assess good faith.  
It evaluates only whether the conditions for eligibility are currently satisfied.

This design avoids ambiguity and ensures that all parties are treated according to the same pre-defined rules.

### Non-Binding Notice

This document is provided for explanatory purposes only.  
It does not create obligations, guarantees, or discretionary pathways.

In the event of any inconsistency between this explanation and the **@E1 Constitution**, the E1 Constitution shall govern.

---

### Summary (Non-Authoritative)

In LCM, API access follows agreement, not the other way around.

An API key is a technical reflection of contractual assent and system eligibility.  
When the conditions for assent are no longer met, API access ends—without interpretation, negotiation, or exception.
