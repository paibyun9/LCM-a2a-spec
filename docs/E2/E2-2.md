# @E2-2. Pre / Post / Gray Zone 0 (Human Guide)
## Understanding State-Based Evaluation Without Exceptions

### Purpose of This Document

This document provides a human-readable explanation of the **Pre / Post / Gray Zone 0** model used by LCM.

It is intended to clarify how LCM evaluates requests and why no intermediate or discretionary decision space exists between defined policy states.

This document is **non-binding** and does not modify or override the **@E1 Constitution**.

---

### Overview: Why Pre / Post Exists

LCM evaluates all interactions using a **state-based model**.

Each request, transaction, or event is assessed by determining whether it satisfies the predefined conditions required for execution (**Pre**) and by producing an outcome that reflects the resulting state (**Post**).

This model ensures that outcomes are derived from objective policy conditions rather than interpretation, negotiation, or situational judgment.

---

### Pre State

**Pre** refers to the set of conditions that must be satisfied *before* any action or outcome can occur.

These conditions are defined explicitly by the applicable vendor policy and system requirements.  
They may include eligibility criteria, time constraints, data completeness, authorization status, or other objective inputs.

If all Pre conditions are satisfied, the request proceeds deterministically to execution.  
If any Pre condition is not satisfied, execution does not occur.

---

### Post State

**Post** refers to the resulting state *after* a request has been evaluated and processed.

The Post state reflects the direct application of the policy to the evaluated inputs.  
It does not represent a recommendation, negotiation, or adjustment.

Once a Post state is reached, it is final with respect to the evaluated event and is not subject to reinterpretation or retroactive modification.

---

### Gray Zone 0: Absence of an Intermediate Decision Space

**Gray Zone 0** means that no intermediate, discretionary, contextual, or human-judgment-based decision space exists between Pre and Post.

In LCM, there is no "Maybe" or "Pending Review" state; a request is either fully compliant or it is not.

LCM does not pause execution to evaluate intent, fairness, hardship, special circumstances, or exceptions.  
It does not escalate ambiguous cases for review or introduce secondary evaluation layers.

Any request, condition, or scenario that cannot be conclusively resolved within the defined Pre conditions does not enter a provisional or negotiable state.  
Instead, it results in a deterministic outcome based solely on the applicable policy or is subject to automatic rejection.

---

### Why Gray Zone 0 Exists

Gray Zone 0 is a deliberate design choice.

Intermediate decision spaces introduce inconsistency, ambiguity, and post-hoc reinterpretation.  
They require discretionary authority, which undermines reproducibility and auditability.

By eliminating the gray zone entirely, LCM ensures that:

- Identical inputs always produce identical outcomes  
- Decisions are traceable to explicit policy conditions  
- No implicit promises or expectations are created  
- Responsibility remains with the policy author, not the execution system  

---

### Human Expectations and System Boundaries

From a human perspective, Gray Zone 0 may appear strict or unaccommodating.

However, LCM does not evaluate whether an outcome is desirable or reasonable.  
It evaluates only whether the defined conditions have been met.

This boundary prevents ad hoc exceptions, silent adjustments, or outcome renegotiation after the fact.

### Non-Binding Notice

This document is provided for explanatory purposes only.  
It does not create obligations, guarantees, or discretionary pathways.

In the event of any inconsistency between this explanation and the **@E1 Constitution**, the E1 Constitution shall govern.

---

### Summary (Non-Authoritative)

Pre defines whether execution is permitted.  
Post reflects the outcome of that execution.  
**Gray Zone 0 ensures that nothing exists between the two.**

LCM operates by closing the space where interpretation, exception, or negotiation would otherwise occur.
