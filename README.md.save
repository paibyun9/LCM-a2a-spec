🧠 What Makes LCM Different

Most systems say:

“Trust us.”

LCM says:

“Verify this.”

Proof is structural

Verification is external

Trust is earned at decision time

🧾 CTO Checklist (Reality Check)

 Server runs

 One-line external demo works

 Pre / Post routes separated

 CanonicalDecision enforced

 Nginx + public access verified

 External curl works (no VPN, no keys)

🏁 Final Statement

LCM is not a promise.
It is a proof system.

If an AI cannot explain why it decided,
then it was never trustworthy to begin with.

Proof. Not Promise.
