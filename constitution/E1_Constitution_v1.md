## E1-1. Single Adjudicator Declaration  
(Vendor Policy Relay)

**Canonical Version – English (Authoritative)**

LCM is not, and shall not be, the adjudicating authority of any policy under any circumstance.

All decisions concerning refunds, cancellations, contracts, rights, and obligations are made exclusively by the Vendor that registered the applicable policy.

LCM operates solely as a neutral middleware that relays vendor-provided policies and resulting outcomes as-is. LCM does not interpret, modify, relax, override, supplement, or re-adjudicate any policy or decision.

By using LCM or any LCM-issued API via any interface or agent, the user, agent, or organization acknowledges and agrees that all results delivered by LCM are relay outcomes derived from vendor policies, and not determinations made by LCM.

In the event of any dispute or misunderstanding, the Vendor’s policy remains the sole source of authority, and LCM shall not be deemed a decision-maker, arbitrator, or judge.
