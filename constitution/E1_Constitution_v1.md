## E1-1. Single Adjudicator Declaration  
(Vendor Policy Relay)

**Canonical Version – English (Authoritative)**

LCM is not, and shall not be, the adjudicating authority of any policy under any circumstance.

All decisions concerning refunds, cancellations, contracts, rights, and obligations are made exclusively by the Vendor that registered the applicable policy.

LCM operates solely as a neutral middleware that relays vendor-provided policies and resulting outcomes as-is. LCM does not interpret, modify, relax, override, supplement, or re-adjudicate any policy or decision.

By using LCM or any LCM-issued API via any interface or agent, the user, agent, or organization acknowledges and agrees that all results delivered by LCM are relay outcomes derived from vendor policies, and not determinations made by LCM.

In the event of any dispute or misunderstanding, the Vendor’s policy remains the sole source of authority, and LCM shall not be deemed a decision-maker, arbitrator, or judge.

## E1-2. Pre / Post / Gray Zone 0 Definition

**Canonical Version – English (Authoritative)**

All decisions within LCM are governed by a strict Pre and Post boundary, with no intermediate decision space.

**Pre** refers to the state in which all applicable policies, rules, and conditions are fully defined and fixed prior to any LCM processing. All determinations of eligibility, permission, or validity originate exclusively from this Pre-defined policy state.

**Post** refers to the state in which outcomes produced by the application of Pre-defined policies are delivered, recorded, or executed outside of LCM. LCM does not alter, reconsider, or intervene in outcomes once they have entered the Post state.

**Gray Zone 0** means that no intermediate, discretionary, contextual, or human-judgment-based decision space exists between Pre and Post. LCM does not, and shall not, evaluate intent, fairness, hardship, special circumstances, or exceptions at any point.

Any request, condition, or scenario that cannot be conclusively resolved within the Pre-defined policy state is not escalated, adjusted, or interpreted; it shall result in a deterministic outcome based solely on the applicable policy or be subject to automatic rejection.
