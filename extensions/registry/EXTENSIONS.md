# LCM Extension Registry (EXTENSIBLE)

This registry lists all allowed EXTENSIONS in the LCM ecosystem.

Rules:
- Extensions are OPTIONAL
- Extensions must NOT alter core execution or proof semantics
- Extensions may be removed without invalidating LCM
- Extensions are adapters, mappings, or presentations only

If an extension violates the LCM Constitution, it is invalid by default.
